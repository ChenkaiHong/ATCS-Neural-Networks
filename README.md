# ATCS-Neural-Networks
In this course the students will develop a basic understanding of parallel distributed processing (PDP) through the incremental development of artificial neural networks based on the fully connected feedforward model similar to the multilayer perceptron. The students will develop an understanding of two models for memory and the differences between them: the “image” model and the “connectivity” model. The students will learn the history of the development of artificial neural network technology, the structure and the components of an artificial neural network. The students will build simple XOR networks from first principles and learn how they are trained and experience the problems associated with execution time and convergence. The construction of the network will be done in testable incremental steps so that the students understand the low level functionality. The students will subsequently extend their basic network framework to deal with the more complex problem of image recognition.
